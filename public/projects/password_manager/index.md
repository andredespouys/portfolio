## Overview: 

The SecureKey Password Manager was developed as a submission project for the entrance application to EPITECH School. Tasked with creating a coding project over a weekend, I combined my interest in cybersecurity with my programming skills to develop a comprehensive password management solution. This project showcases a robust, user-friendly application designed to securely store and manage passwords.

## Technology: 

SecureKey was built using Python, with the Tkinter UI library for the graphical user interface. This combination allowed for the creation of a straightforward yet effective user experience. The backend of the application features full encryption, ensuring that all stored passwords maintain a high level of security. The project also includes comprehensive documentation, written in English, detailing the functionality and architecture of the application, making it easy for users to understand and utilize.
