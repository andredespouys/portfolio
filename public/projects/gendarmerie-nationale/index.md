### The context üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

During the cybersecurity week at my university last year, my classmates and I had the honor of collaborating with the National Gendarmerie (Bordeaux). Together, we developed two digital solutions aimed at assisting gendarmerie professionals and civilian communities in mitigating the multitude of everyday cybersecurity threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.




### What did we develop? ü§ì

Our focus during the two-week project, particularly within my team, was the creation of an application designed to enhance gendarmes' ability to identify digital objects utilized in criminal activities such as stalking, securing sensitive data, and managing connected devices. This application also streamlined the process of digital asset collection during perquisition, facilitating their utilization in criminal records and court proceedings.

I personally took care of all the application integration using the **PandaSuite** software solution.

Simultaneously, another team was tasked with developing a public website promoting good practices in internet usage and digital environments. The website can be accessed here ‚Üí <a href="https://safe-n-tech.netlify.app/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Safe-n-Tech</a>.


### What did I learn? üßê
Participation in this project proved immensely enlightening on both professional and personal fronts.

Effective communication was paramount throughout the project, ensuring alignment among team members and supervisors from the Gendarmerie to validate data collection for integration into the application.

Furthermore, interacting with real professionals confronted with the technological challenges of combating cybercrime provided invaluable insight into the tangible impact of our work on safeguarding individuals and their data.

Above all, the dedication and passion exhibited by the professionals we encountered left a lasting impression. Their commitment serves as my motivation for transitioning my focus from web development to cybersecurity education, with the aim of leveraging digital skills to protect lives and data

This experience was yet another remarkable opportunity for personal and professional growth, culminating in the development of a solution still utilized by the National Gendarmerie today.
