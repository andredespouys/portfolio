This project serves as a tribute to Samira, a courageous woman whose story is emblematic of the resilience and spirit of many in her community.

## Objective: 

The main goal of this project was to create an immersive and interactive narrative that could convey the emotional and physical journey of Samira from Ukraine to France. Through the use of <b>three.js</b>, we crafted a three-dimensional storytelling platform that allows users to engage with Samira's experiences in a visually rich environment.

The project features a dynamic 3D scene that guide the user through various stages of Samira's journey, enhanced by a song chosen by Samira that add depth and context to her story.
