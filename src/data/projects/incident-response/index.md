### The context of this project üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

As part of my current Google Cybersecurity Certificate; inside the Network Attacks Module I was instructed to conduct an incident report.

The following document is a representation of how i would respond following a network attack of this kind inside my organisation.

### Ghost Company Incident Report üßê

I'm working on a normal day at Ghost Company, suddenly I receive an automated alert from our SIEM Tool indicating a problem with the web server. I attempte to visit the company‚Äôs website, but I receive a connection timeout error message in the browser.

**Following the company's security protocols**, I take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. I follow to configure the company‚Äôs firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. I know that this IP blocking solution **won‚Äôt last long**, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block.

I need to alert my manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. I will also need to be prepared to tell my boss about the type of attack I discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

## First I need to **identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption ü§ì**

Using Wireshark to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server:

## <a href ="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_MD7T5GCrzvyYnq1_PXUse-aB26lF34YUvNDrj0vg8U/edit?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#341677">This are the logs I got üëÄ </a>

Taking into account the error message, I can start to think about a **DoS Attack**, the word **timeout** suggests that the test request we made was waiting for a response but the server couldn't.

Reading the logs from Wireshark, I instantly notice a large number of **TCP SYN requests** coming from an unfamiliar IP address **203.0.113.0**. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. I strongly suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor.

<hr style="opacity:1;color:#341677">

## Now I need to explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction and alert my manager üëç

We can see from the logs that the IP Address **203.0.113.0** started making a real connection at the time: **3.390692**. It completed the handshake but then, it started making tons of SYN requests.

**Knowing the TCP/IP Protocol**, we know that to form a connection between two devices, there are three steps.
<ol>
<li>‚úÖ A SYN packet is sent from the source to the destination, requesting to
connect.</li>
<li>‚úÖ The destination replies to the source with a SYN-ACK packet to accept the connection request. The destination will reserve resources for the source to connect</li>
<li>‚úÖ A final ACK packet is sent from the source to the destination acknowledging the permission to connect.</li>
</ol>

So the multiple sending of SYN Packets the server not having enough resources or a correct DoS firewall set up, can cause the server to collapse and not be able to serve all the other requests made by other users and consequently throwing the **timeout error message**.


### My recommendations üõ†Ô∏è

DoS attack take down one of the pillars of the CIA triad - Availability. This concerns the company's reputation and daily operations, so fixing this and future lookalike errors is crucial for good business continuity.

**The solutions I would propose are:**

‚úÖ Setting the firewalls limit number of SYN packets per IP Address to a logical number can be one of the solutions.

‚úÖ Setting an alert using our SIEM Tool to notice possible future SYN Attacks and block the IP Adresses for future alternative attacks.


## And voil√† !

As my current career objective is to become a Security Analyst, I'm following this certificate to land an entry-level position in the near future. Thank you for reading this article
