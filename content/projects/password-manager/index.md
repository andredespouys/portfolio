## The context of this project üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

 In this document, I embark on the thrilling chronicle of my endeavor to create a robust and secure password manager using Python. This project is not merely a coding challenge but a testament to my commitment to enhancing my cybersecurity and coding skills.

Since I‚Äôm new to the field and currently graduate of the Google Cybersecurity course, I wanted to start my practical projects with some coding (which I love) to create a practical project so me and maybe people in the future can use it. 

## Project Overview:

As Igot my certificate of cybersecurity from Google, I am now able to develop some real life projects. With my experience in coding and Python, I decided to create this password manager.

The aim of this password manager is to provide a seamless and secure solution for storing and managing sensitive credentials. Leveraging Python's versatility, I have chosen to build a reliable application that adheres to the highest standards of encryption and user experience.

## Development Stack:

Python serves as the cornerstone of this project, allowing me to harness its power and flexibility. Within the Python ecosystem of libraries I am using:

<ul>
    <li>The Tkinter built-in library for a simple user interface. </li>
    <li>hashlib - a library that provides secure hash functions, including SHA-256, for creating hash values from data, often used for password hashing and data integrity verification.</li>
    <li>getpass: A library for safely and interactively entering sensitive information like passwords without displaying the input on the screen. Similar to the way the Linux terminals are.</li>
    <li>os: A library for interacting with the operating system, allowing you to perform tasks like file and directory manipulation.</li>
    <li>json is a library for encoding and decoding JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, commonly used for data serialization and interchange.</li>
    <li>pyperclip: A library for clipboard operations, enabling you to programmatically copy and paste text to and from the clipboard in a platform-independent way.</li>
    <li>sys: This module is a built-in Python module that provides access to various system-specific parameters and functions.</li>
    <li>cryptography.fernet: Part of the cryptography library, it provides the Fernet symmetric-key encryption method for securely encrypting and decrypting data.</li>
</ul>

## Current Milestone: Debugging Core Functionalities

Currently, in my PAssword manager I can identify myself with the master key. I can add passwords and retrieve them. 

The next steps are to modify/delete each one of those. More securitization of the input, a password suggestor and why not, MORE design !
